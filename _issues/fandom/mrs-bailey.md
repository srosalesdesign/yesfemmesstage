    <div class="text-wrapper"><p>During the summer of 2016 I drove from Los Angeles, CA to Beaufort, SC in Texas and Louisiana at sites listed in The Negro Motorist Green Book.  The Negro Motorist Green Book was initially published in 1936 and was in print until 1966.  The book  provided safety information for Black families while traveling across the United States in their cars. Although many of the families were able to avoid segregation on public transportation by driving cars, other dangers such as racially-motivated police harassment often arose on the road. Additionally there were many gas stations, restaurants, and hotels that would refuse service to African American travelers. The Green Book served as a crucial companion for Black travelers to find safe travel routes and spaces where they could eat and sleep safely with their families. The last copy was published in 1966, following the Civil Rights Act of 1964, outlawing racial discrimination, which made people believe the need for the book was obsolete.  In the summer of 2015 Sandra Bland, a 28 year old woman from Chicago Illinois was found hanged in her cell in Waller County Texas, after a traffic stop in Prairie View, Texas. She was pulled over for failure to signal a lane change. Eye-witness accounts, cell phone footage, and tampered police dashcam footage reveal aggressive and violent tactics used to remove Sandra Bland from her vehicle. Her death and the innumerable deaths of African descended people and people of color at the hands of the police brings up the question of whether the need for The Green Book is in fact obsolete. </p>
        <p>The ability to have determination over mobility can be linked to liberation in the context of slavery. Slavery greatly inhabited the mobility of Africans who worked under forced labor, and reconstruction era laws worked to continue to limit the mobility of African Americans across geographic space. During Jim Crow, although African Americans owned cars and in theory possessed mobile freedom, racially motivated harassment hindered the ability to move freely across state lines. The Green Book addressed this issue, the case of Sandra Bland brings up current issues with mobility hinderance. During my drive across country I will collected sound through field recordings, met with historians of color and wrote about my cross country drive.</p>

        <p>The following piece is based on a conversation that I had with a woman whose home was listed in the Green Book under the category </p>
        <p><i>** The people interviewed in the sound piece are Elaine, who grew up taking piano lessons in one of the homes listed in the Green Book and Mrs. Bailey, who’s home was listed in the Green Book, where she rented rooms for travelers.</i></p>
        <p>After leaving  Elaine’s house on Jackson Avenue, I got in my car contemplating whether to go to the next house. I felt like I was pulled by a force greater than me to focus on the tourist homes because according to my logic, it made more sense to focus on social spaces such as beauty parlors and barber shops in terms of the amount of spaces that I would be able to document. I decided to listen to the pull and felt grateful to meet the black homeowners I met who were all very excited about my work and seemed to have resources and be willing to share information. I knew I had to hit the road soon and drive seven hours to go to Dallas, but something told me to stop at just one more tourist home and spend one hour there.. I wasn’t even sure if anyone would be at home or willing to talk to me and invite me in their home but I put the address into my gps and made my way to a house which was just several blocks down from where I was on Jackson avenue. </p>
        <p>I got out of my car with my camera, phone, wallet and keys and walked up to a big two story house with a spiral staircase in the front. I pulled on the gate, letting myself in and felt surprised by how easily the gate opened. I rang the bell halfway not expecting anyone to come to the door. When an older black woman who was, my guess, in her early 70’s, with a close-to-her-head cropped silver afro answered the door, opening the screen door with one hand and holding a black cordless phone to her ear with the other. </p>

        <p>She was mid sentence, looked at me and said, <i>“hello?”</i></p>
        <p>I said, “Hello, my name is Charmaine and I am working on a research project about the Green Book and am going to different tourist homes…” </p>
        <p>Cutting in, she said,  “My house was listed in the Green book and I can’t find my copy.” </p>
        <p>Astonished and suddenly feeling shy I asked, “Are <i>you</i>  Mrs. Bailey?”</p>
        <p>She said, “I sure am and this is my house!” She let out a laugh.</p>
        <p>I said, “The book listed a NJ B.”</p>
        <p>She said, “NJ B was my husband.”</p>
        <p>I said, “I am not sure what you are up to today, but if you have five minutes but I would love to speak with you some about this being a tourist home in the Green Book.” </p>
        <p>She said, “Well sure, come right on in.” </p>

<p>I walked into the house. It was beautiful with a long corridor and wooden floors. She led me toward the back into a beautiful living room area with a mantle filled with sepia pictures of folks who were, my guess, her ancestors. She led me to a dining room table behind the living room mantle and I saw a sewing machine. I said, “Oh, do you sew? I sew too!” </p>
    <p>She invited me to sit down and began to immediately go into how her husband purchased the house in the 1930’s and she began living there in 1935. I asked her if it was okay with her for me to record our meeting. She said, “Sure honey, go ahead.” Throughout our meeting she called me “baaaby" and “honey child” making me feel so happy and at home, and reminding me of the grandmother energy I had been praying for. </p>
    <p>She went on to tell me that she was 97 and born in 1919 . I shared with her that my grandmother was born in the same year, August 5. She told me her birthday was on November 1; I said mine was on October 31. I felt myself  so drawn to and comfortable with Mrs. Bailey, who told me her first name was Dorothy.</p>
    <p>She began to tell me about how she worked in insurance, but did not expect to go into that industry. She had suddenly become pregnant with,   I believe, her third child upon finding out she was out of work and trying to figure out how to make money. She sewed and did tailoring work on the side for many people in the community but knew that she needed more money flowing in.</p>
    <p>She told me about how she went into the store and was told that she could no longer use her husband’s credit card. She told me how her hair was down to her back, her titties were sitting high and her waist was tiny and her hips were big.  How when the person working the counter said she couldn’t use her husband’s credit she felt astonished. The man then began complimenting her clothes, which she had made. Whenever he asked her a question, she had a quick response back to him.</p>
    <p>He asked her, “Mrs. Bailey, would you like your own line of credit?  All you have to do is pay your bill on time and you can shop anywhere you want and get the things you need.” </p>
    <p>She said, “I most certainly would like my own line of credit.”</p>
    <p>She told me about how she went on to use her credit to buy other homes in New Orleans. She told me that I can have whatever I want and to remember the biggest cost in buying a house is the down payment.</p>
    <p>She went on to tell me how she would go into stores and be told one price and in her mind know how much she wanted to spend. She’d walk into another space and get lower than what she wanted to spend. I thought to myself, this is a true and powerful Oshun. She talked about how when her daughter went to sign for her house they told her daughter that they wouldn’t allow her to use her mother as a cosigner because her father had died. Mrs. Bailey said she drove to Shreveport met with the loan officer, pulled out all her credit cards and proof that she was a credible co-signer and told him, “go ahead now, hurry up, I have to go.” Her daughter got the house. </p>
    <p>She told me about how she made friends with a meat seller and was able to buy meat at wholesale prices and share this food with her community. Her husband bought their house with the intention of making it into a hotel. She wanted to make it into a home for their children.</p>
    <p>Back to her needing a job.  She went to work for a friend at a ball and was put on the cash register.  A man had asked her if she was married to the man who ran the ball and she had said no, she was not married to him but her friend was. He said, “I think you’d be good working in insurance.” She said, “I’ve never done that before.” He told her to call him on Tuesday about a job. </p>
    <p>On Tuesday he ended up calling her and asking her where she was on that day. She said she was busy helping a friend out and said she would have to come by later. When she did go by, she was given the job. She sold insurance for over 22 years. She sold insurance in the black community and took the months August and December off every year.  None of her policies ever went into default and whenever she had money she would donate to the causes of the church and the people who so faithfully kept policies with her. </p>
    <p><strong><i>The phone rang It was her daughter checking on her.</i></strong></p>
    <p>She then told me that before I arrived , while she was in the bathroom and on the toilet she tipped over and hit her head. Her daughter had told her not to go to sleep and she thought to herself how am I gonna do that, not sleep for six hours? She said,  “and that’s when you rang the doorbell. Everything happens for a reason. “</p>
    <p>She went on to tell me about how she had a miscarriage at 8 months pregnant and how someone got rid of the body of the baby and how that hurt her, not knowing where the baby was buried and that she told the doctor the baby could’ve gone in their mausoleum. She again mentioned that she was so happy that I came and that she’s grateful to be talking to me because she didn’t know how she would stay awake. </p>
    <p>The time went on and I became worried about driving through Texas late at night and I said, “Mrs. Bailey I have to go now, I have to get on the road to go to Dallas.” </p>
    <p>She said, “well let me show you this room I haven’t shown you.”</p>
    <p> She showed me her room, there was an incredibly crafted quilt on the bed that she said she had made herself by hand. She also had stuffed rabbits on the bed and I asked her if she loved rabbits.  There was also a picture of a rabbit outside of the room door. She told me her nickname was Rabbit and they were calling her that because of the amount of children she had. She pointed up to a picture of the Virgin Mary and said after Katrina there was a fire in the building that was once next door to hers and the fire impacted and damaged some items in her home. She said of all things the Virgin was not damaged, that the glass frame cracked and the picture rolled up a little, and thats it. I asked her which Virgin it was. She said Guadalupe but I pointed to the healing waters. She said, “It’s whichever one runs the healing waters, then.”  I asked if it was Lourdes, the Virgin Mary who had been speaking to me the most. I walked over to the mantle in her room and saw a picture of Saint Anthony and one of Saint George. She said, “Saint Anthony will help you find anything you need when you lose it.” I agreed with her and said, “He helps you immediately.” I told her I didn’t know much about St. George. She said, “He helps you with money.” I said, “That’s good to know.” There was a glass of water by the image of St. George. As we were walking out of the room she stopped by a dark skinned depiction of Marie Laveau and just looked at me and smiled and tapped on the wall. I smiled back.</p>
    <p>She took me to the furthest front room which had many angels and she showed me her area with wood and a rosary and a beautiful pot that did not get damaged in the fire. Her daughter then called and she put me on the phone with her. They both said that it was best that I didn’t drive to Dallas and Mrs. B said that I should spend the night.</p>
    <p>I started to feel scared but that it was true I shouldn’t drive to Dallas this late, something in my spirit was screaming no - not to drive to Dallas. I told Mrs. Bailey that I had to go to the community bookstore real quick  to let them know that I was leaving the next day and that I’d be back. Before I left the house I looked up at the door to see a horse shoe turned upright covered in white cloth with St. Anthony and St. George on either side. I knew I was protected and in the home of a very powerful woman.</p>
    <p>I went to the book store to see Ms. Vera and Mama Jenn and walked in on a room filled with black women of many ages participating in a  “sister symposium.”  I sat down then walked across the room behind the speaker to see Mama Jenn and hug her, as I walked across the speaker called me out and asked me what I do. I said that I make healing teas and am an artist, and Mrs. Vera said “What else?” and gave me that look. I then introduced my Green Book project and people seemed very interested and moved. Mrs. Vera offered to have me stay at her place.   I told her something felt off about staying with Mrs. Bailey, but I later recognized that not as my fear, but my mother’s worry and cast it aside. Mrs. Vera gave me her key and texted me throughout the night to make sure I made it in safely.</p>
    <p>I went back to Mrs. Bailey’s house and told her I would only stay for a while, which she basically shut down completely by saying that it was too late to leave.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Bailey showed me to the room where I would be staying. Before that, she introduced the room by saying that her daughter Gwen also loved to camp and that it was her room.  It was called  the angel room. It was filled with beautiful antique gold furniture and felt like Oshun’s room. There were black angels everywhere.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Baileys granddaughter Malisa came over and after my call I joined them downstairs to talk.  Malisa started talking about herbs she was taking for healing. After I mentioned that I make tea, Mrs. Bailey mentioned that she had edema and asked what herbs she could take. I recommended ginger and told her I’d put together a tea for her. I asked her if she’d ever worked with herbs and she said no but that her mother and grandmother did, and that people from all over would come to them for salves and herbs for their period cramps.</p>
    <p>I felt tired and went to bed. I woke up to this 97-year-old woman cooking a huge pot of grits, boiling sausage, and making coffee. She asked me to sit down and have a cup of coffee and talked to me, making sure I would call her when I reached Dallas. I told her I would. She wished me safe travels.</p>
