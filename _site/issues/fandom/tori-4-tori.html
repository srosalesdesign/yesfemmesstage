        <p>Kenneth, a senior at my HS when I was a freshman, had hairsprayed crispy, spiked hair, light brown skin, and wore a navy blue polo in his junior yearbook photo. Over the phone Kenneth played me "Lost in Love" by the Nastyboy Klik, a Spanglish R&amp;B song popular on hip-hop stations across the Southwest. âLost in Loveâ was Kennethâs favorite song. Kenneth told me âFire It Upâ by Busta Rhymes sampled the Knight Rider theme song. Kenneth couldnât believe I had never heard of Knight Rider. Two months later I had the screen name âFireItUp6.â This was in the middle of a period of using Tori Amos song titles for my gay screen names. My straight friend Jerry later recalled in disbelief that it was me who called her âTori Anusâ all the time. That was maybe only a year before I got the poster of Tori nursing a piglet that my mother demanded I remove, repeatedly yelling that it was sick. For my straight friends I was âVow15â and later âVow16,â a gothy song by Garbage, plus my age. Jerry introduced me to Shirley Manson. One afternoon after school at Jerryâs, a music video came on MTV in his room and he said âyou really need to see this.â I think Jerry thought it was the kind of female singer Iâd have a crush on, and for a while that became my explanation. A backlit guitarist, bassist and drummer in greyish blues, oranges and purples play to sawing noises and grinds. Then, standing defiantly still to an almost danceable mid-tempo rhythm, a woman at the mic does not smile or make an innocently seductive face. You could call it a pissed look if only she cared. A large area around her eyes is black. Sheâs telling a girl that sheâs a phony just to be liked, that everything she actually had she wasted. What should the girl have done with what she had? Years later, when I came out to Jerry, he couldnât believe how well he was duped the whole time, that all the signs had been in plain sight.</p>
        <p>Kenneth was Navajo. Kennethâs parents never married, though they were a couple for at least as long as he had been alive. Did his parents celebrate anniversaries? Eat dinner together? Live together? Kenneth told me they did, in an apartment complex near the CostCo on Jefferson. Maybe Kenneth played the Nastyboy Klik song to tell me he wanted to get lost in love with me. I donât know if this was a thing people did. All I know is my middle school friend Shannon Fudge and I would play songs back and forth over the phone, holding cordless receivers to our boom boxes to have a conversation. We once used most of an evening and all of Jagged Little Pill to communicate that she had a crush on me. That was not long before I had to buy a second Jagged Little Pill because my first was so scratched. I got my first copy by exchanging The Fugeesâ The Score because, I still remember, on the way home from the mall, I turned to my father and said it had a parental advisory sticker. âShould we return it?â my father asked. âI guess so,â 12 year-old me responded.</p>
        <p>School was seven hours of half-awake hiding in a notebook drawing cats and a goth sneering drag queen-ish character of my own invention, and then I came back to the computer. My parents interrupted to make me eat dinner and play piano, the only other piece of furniture in the small computer room, its French doors opening to the open floor plan living room where my mother watched The Nanny or my father watched the British Parliament on C-Span. I kept the doors closed. At 11 PM my mother would burst in and yank the phone cord from the wall in a dramatic show of force. Some nights I would sneak back to the computer room and plug the phone cord back into the wall, but only after waiting a few hours until my parents had gone to sleep, in the interim listening to Tidal or Tigerlily or Eurythmicsâ Greatest Hitsâmy first album purchase ever at age 11. When I played âSweet to my parents, they said the music was fake, because there were no actual instruments. I think this was a popular commentary on disco and synth music in that time. One time my mother walked in on âSweet Dreams Are Made of Thisâ and hit the pause button. âDid she just say some of them want to abuse you? Abuse?â My mother said this like the answer would determine whether or not the CD would go in the trash. âNo, amuse,â I said.</p>
        <p>Kenneth and I exchanged multipage locker notes. At the top of my stack of brown paper bag wrapped textbooks, tiny folded packages appeared that opened up to "Hey cutie =)" with a handwritten equals sign and end parenthesis, plus a full page of hard-to-read cursive in smeared pencil. My responses were full of questions because I missed whole paragraphs. In one note Kenneth told me to find him in an outdoor patio area at our high school that I didnât know was there. It was just through the doors past the school cafeteria, a short walk from where I always ate lunch with the Creative Writing Club girls sitting cross-legged on the cold, tile floor, the massive buildingâs interior resembling an airport concourse or 80s shopping mall. Everyone made small talk about the building and how it made them feel like they were at the mall. We described our lunch spot as âbehind the bear,â a taxidermy adult black bear named âOsoâ who greeted students every 8:20 AM from his glass case at the schoolâs entrance. (A year after I graduated, a kid from the competing high school set fire to Oso. Iâm not sure if Oso was replaced.) In the other direction, I went through the cafeteria doors and found tall cinder block walls enclosing metal mesh picnic tables, little trees and a trashcan. Kenneth was there, joke-fighting with his friend Shawn who had a higher pitched voice with a valley girl rise ending his sentences. Two years later Shawnâs freckle faced younger brother, who wore a baseball cap and alternative rock band shirts, drove me in his pick-up truck to the new (and Albuquerqueâs first) stadium seating movie theater, bought me a coke and put his arm around me. I donât remember which film we saw. Maybe it was the younger brother who was named Shawn. A 2016 Facebook search revealed the younger brotherâs name to be Adam, and that he was now a Trump supporter.</p>

        <p>I waited all evening for StinkyBird to appear in my buddy list, and if he did, I double-clicked immediately. Justin, who hoped to become a make-up stylist, had dyed-blond curly hair and medium brown complexion, a nasally voice, was about 5â6â and very skinny. My mother drove us to a movie, thinking Justin was a friend from school, which was basically true. Once a boy from Denver sent me his photo in the mail. My mother would reorganize all my belongings when I wasnât homeâsome of my possessions would disappear completelyâso Iâm sure she found his high school yearbook picture and letter. That was at least a year before my mother pounded on my door, entered my bedroom, paused and said demandingly: Stephen, âare you a homosexual?â I looked her in the eye and said no. âAre you sure?â I said yes I was sure. My mother told me many times that if a homosexual man tried to hurt me that she would âbeat the shit out ofâ him.</p>

        <p>The first time I saw Jay, he didnât know I was viewing him, that it was me, Spark926, from online, standing in line or offering my ticket to see Deep Impact. Jay told me where he workedâThe Dollar Theaterâand where he livedâin the Albuquerque neighborhood with foreign capital street names, like Paris Ave or Jakarta St. The Dollar Theater gave me a warm feeling. It was where I saw Stargate four years earlier with Chris OâNeill, a neighborhood boy with a strong jaw, red freckles, blond hair and squinting eyes, with whom I spent entire days playing Sonic 3, watched Roseanne and The Simpsons with 3D glasses that came with a happy meal, and did flips with him and his sister on a giant outdoor trampoline, where his upside-down skull hovered an inch above the metal frame before his body came back down again, and where, a few feet from the trampoline, Chris showed me how to light a match on my front teeth. Chrisâs sister had a mullet.</p>
        <p>My only memory of Deep Impact: I joked to my friend Pam that Jodi Foster looked like Ellen DeGeneres, because she was blonde, I guess. Because I had to say something at some point. Pam and I both laughed at how terribly inaccurate that was. Somehow I didnât know they, or Pam, were lesbians. Pam and I called each other boyfriend and girlfriend for a while. We never kissed, maybe never hugged. We ultimately stopped dating because at a Garbage concert I repeatedly screamed I love you at Shirley Manson, the lead singer. I was confused and surprised that that would bother Pam. Jay had peroxide bleached hair that parted down the middle like a grunge singer, stopping just past his ears, over his wire frame glasses that magnified his almond eyes to cartoon proportions. The artificial blondness of his hair emphasized his tan, round face. Jay was in a bright red vest theater outfit and the place smelled of fake butter. Back home online, Jay was flattered, and surprised he didnât recognize me.</p>
        <p>I told my mother I was going for a walk. I trudged for an hour through rolling hills of creosote and yellow sagebrush to get to the Phillips 66 gas station that in my mind was just up the street. There was no sidewalk. No one was supposed to walk from my house to that gas station. Out of breath, parched, in baggy black cargo pants and an oversized Garbage Version 2.0 shirt, I spotted Jayâs two-door Honda. In pictures Jay wore skater bro clothes like maybe he skied in Taos a lot. In person and not as a ticket ripper, Jay had on a red polo shirt, his eyes still magnified. Jay, who had been waiting for two hours, trembled as he leaned toward me, stared and tried to say hi. The sun set as he drove us to La Luz Trail in the Sandia MountainsâSandia, watermelon, because Spanish explorers may have thought the mountains looked pink as the sun set with a green rind of trees on top. I may have suggested La Luz, as it was the trail I knew best. I went there as a little kid and climbed pink granite boulders or ran past them, far ahead of my father and back. Jay and I searched for a place near the parking lot where we could both sit. Jay had a hard time staying erect. I waited with him to get close for over an hour. His penis flopped around in my hand. Jay needed to do it a special way to cum. I had never been sexual with a guy before. Neither had he, he said, a decade later on Facebook messenger before suggesting that we meet again. The last time I checked his Facebook profile, he was Jay Man. Still in New Mexico, he was a much bigger guy in his 30s with a shaved head. In 2017 I went to the gym with Quinn while in New Mexico on a self-imposed writing retreat, and on Grindr a guy wrote âSteven?â who was in the same gym in his photo, and it turned out to be Jay Man. With Quinn in the hot tub, I waited until we left to respond.</p>

        <p>Quinn and I first bonded in the main chat of the AOL Albuquerque M4M room joking about the screen names of older gay men like NMRimmer, ABQtop4u, BoiGemni and BiMarrdGy whose screen names were always at the bottom of the chat list, meaning they had been in the chat room the longest, possibly for weeks or months. They mostly ignored my messages. I wondered if they forgot to log off, but then sometimes they would respond, usually begrudgingly, and disappear when the topic shifted away from sex.</p>
        <p>It seemed as though the M4M room was the gay capital of Albuquerque for a time. A user âMPowerABQâ entered the room every night to advertise a non-profit hangout place for 18-29 gay men to learn about safe sex. I remember the guys in the chat room discussing new music releases like they all somehow liked the same random things, including Tori when I still didnât know her music, and every night for at least a week, Madonnaâs âFrozen.â It was that summer, driving through Tennessee on a family road trip, that From the Choirgirl Hotel made so much sense. Tori wanted to know why screaming in cathedrals couldnât be beautiful and why there had to be a sacrifice.</p>
        <p>Quinn had a deep voice on the phone and a way of responding that let you know he was agreeing with you because he really did and not only because he wanted to. The first two times Quinn and I met, he picked me up at the street corner and we jerked off in a parking lot in his car. Quinn, pale white with a goatee, tucked in black shirt and combat boots, looked like he could be military personnel. Quinn told me he was homeschooled until he got his GED after he brought a gun to his HS and was expelled. Quinn also once told me in confidence that he woke up from a night terror holding a loaded gun to his head. Quinn and I had in common that we were both arrested and sent to the D Homeâthe juvenile detention centerâin Albuquerque. Quinn used to steal computers.</p>
        <p>My parents and I went once a week to family counselor Gerry Swanson. During one meeting, I went back to the waiting room so Mr. Swanson could talk to my parents. There I found a photo of the singer of Garbage, Shirley Manson, in a magazine, so I ripped it out. When my parents were done talking, they came back to the waiting room refreshed to see me, but smiles quickly turned to frowns. They said I vandalized Mr. Swansonâs magazine and demanded I give back the ripped page to him. I couldnât abandon Shirley Mansonâs eyeliner or leave any part of my bedroom walls blank. If it wasnât her face, I didnât feel like I had any face at all. Instead, I ran out of the building and walked several unfamiliar blocks through Downtown Albuquerque. From a gas station payphone I dialed 1-800-COLLECT and the number to Quinnâs parentsâ houseâI still have it memorized. Quinn picked me upâprobably our fourth meeting in personâand drove us back toward the mountain to my house. My parents were already there waiting for us. They had beers with Quinn while I sat in the other room on the computer.</p>
        <p>Quinn and I would re-watch the Eurythmics music video collection on VHS so many times I had a kind of memorized commentary Iâd rehash to any new viewers, like âlook at her pointy bra,â or âwho would wear a leopard print coat at the zoo?â The day I got that VHS was the same day my mother and I got in a car accident, and she died. Watching all twenty-one Eurythmics music videos was the last thing we did together. My mother hardly said anything through those two hours. I often wonder if watching Annie Lennox wearing a giant white wig and screaming âI need a manâ over and over was my coming out to her.</p>

        <p>At Tommyâs party either Ben or his boyfriend Henry was dressed as Superman. Henry was big, muscly and Mediterranean looking, while Ben was pale, skeletal and frail looking. Somehow I canât remember if I saw a big and muscly or a scrawny superman. Henry told me about a time he was fucking a guy who was annoying him, whining and in some way being particular, so Henry peed inside the guyâs butt.</p>
        <p>Ben, a.k.a. âBenaâ or âDJ Bena,â who owned a dance music record store, took me there the second time I met him. Ben was no longer with Henry and I knew this. On the way Ben played me an advance copy of the new Madonna single âMusicâ that he said he got before the radio stations. I remember feeling like Madonna sounded bored but that maybe that was a good thing. During our third or fourth listen, Ben was full of information about Madonnaâs collaborating producer, and I tried to sound interested.</p>

        <p>At Felixâs DJ booth, Felix gave me an Annie Lennox vinyl that I had no way of playing. That was around the time I wrote an essay about Annie Lennox for a correspondence course. I took eleven courses by mail from the University of Oklahoma so I could graduate high school early, drop out of my early morning classes, and fix my GPA, replacing Ds and Cs from my cat drawing freshman and sophomore years with surprisingly easy As. The Annie Lennox essay was a two-page double-spaced informative biography that I paraphrased from a book. A decade later, as I was Googling myself, the essay appeared on a free essays site.</p>
        <p>Felix was friends with Bena. Felix and Bena both moved to San Diego in the late 2000s. On a weekly basis on MySpace and, later, Facebook, Felix posted group photos with club people he just met. Also, sometimes, he posted semi-suicidal posts, saying in some way that he was at the end. In the comments Felix appeased concerned friends.</p>

        <p>Daniel and I became friends on Xanga.com, a blogging site similar to the more popular LiveJournal, but I chose Xanga because it didnât require an account to leave a comment. And because Max Villaraigosa, my boyfriend of three years, was already on Xanga. I found new people on Xanga by joining groups around shared interests, like âSoCal Gaysâ or âGay Goth Boysâ or âTori Amos.â</p>
        <p>About a month before I met him, Daniel would give âePropsâ to my Xanga blog entries, including one I titled âone of the worst days of the year so far.â It was the day I found out Max would be spending the summer in South Africa. Max commented that he hoped I could at least be a little happy for him.
</p>
<p>Daniel was the first guy I met under the new rules of my relationship with Max. Max and I had an exchangeâeither over the phone or instant message, I canât rememberâthat gave me the impression that our relationship would be open, and we could have sex with others, while he was in South Africa for the summer.</p>
<p>A few months before that, Max and I had an argument about the word "culture." I said that Max should travel domestically more because American culture as a whole would be interesting to investigate. Max responded that he was now seeing how America was really many cultures beneath a hegemonic structure. Max said I was thinking about culture more philosophically, and he more anthropologicallyâhis major. Max felt he was missing out on the rest of the world. I used a definition of culture from the OED to argue that many cultures can exist within one culture, and Max retorted that the dictionary doesn't mean anything. Then Max said I have a tendency to come up with blanket answers to complicated questions, that it kept me from investigating them further. Later, I wanted to tell Max he was right, that my real goal was to persuade him to be near me, that I should have just said I would miss him, that I admired his brain and that I would cry when he was gone. And I did, all summer.</p>
<p>Looking back at my defensiveness of America as being worthy of Maxâs exploration, I wondered if I was more likely defending Tori Amos' concept album Scarlet's Walk. A turning point in Toriâs career, the album was themed around a character named Scarlet who travels through every state in post-9/11 America as she also journeys through modern womanhood. Furthermore, I wondered how many times his dislike for this albumâor any song by Tori, or by the band Rasputina, for that matterâfueled unnecessary arguments on my part. Later-me also wanted to tell then-me that Maxâs opinion of Tori and Rasputina was never going to change.</p>
<p>Driving down the 5 at night, what once seemed like a daytrip now was a half-hour drive. My father, who visited Los Angeles in the 1940s before freeways were built, said it took an entire day to get across LA. Daniel, who was much cuter in person, played songs, and I asked for the titles. Danielâs bedroom was entirely empty except for his bed. We lay in it, talked and fooled around. Daniel said he was versatile. A year after that, in a blog entry, I said I wanted to go to Death Valley on the hottest day of the year. Daniel commented that he would be willing to pick me up and drive us there. A few years after that, Danielâs name would show up on Spotify in the far right column, and I would click on the song and it would always be good.</p>

        <p>Dan, a graphic designer, said over instant message he was of Assyrian descent. I joked that I had a fetish for guys from ancient civilizations. Dan informed me that there are still Assyrians. Dan said his father was Iraqi but that he got used to saying Assyrian instead for his own safety.
</p>
<p>On the same trip, I visited my half-brother and his family in Upstate NY. With my toddler nephews and niece I saw The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe in a theater. I could not stop staring at Tilda Swinton as the White Witch, who appears in white fur robes with icicle tiaras, her hair either like branches covered in frost or slightly dreaded to have a mane-like appearance. With emotionless eyes, she towers over the little boy, Edward, tempting him to come with her, offering Turkish Delights. Is it supposed to be sexual? Is she a pedophile? Tilda could be Edwardâs mother. While she is not a conventionally attractive womanâshe has no eyebrowsâin a blog entry on Xanga, I wrote that she was so sexy. Then, I made a strange and indulgent comparison between the battle at the end of the film between her and the lion and the âbattleâ in my life, the lion being Max, now my ex, whom I nicknamed âBig Lionâ in our early years. But who did I think was Tilda? Was I saying I was bisexual? Did I yearn to be tempted by or comforted byâor, was it actually me who wasâthe White Witch?</p>
<p>One time I sent a message to a guy who in a picture posed with the White Witch at an amusement park, saying I was jealous, and he never responded.</p>

        <p>Justin Starer was a decade-old member of an Alanis Morissette fan club. A few years before we met, Justin sent me to a website with photo albums of him with other Alanis fans. Each folder showed meetings in a different cityâSt. Louis, Miami, Boston. The fans would fly in and share hotel rooms together. They knew each other first as users commenting on a forum in the mid-90s. The pictures showed the groupâteenage boys and girls of varying ages, sizes and racesâgoing from braces and 90s hair to full grown adults, every year cuddling in a big pile on a hotel bed, bonded seemingly for life over their shared love of the angry, emotive alternative rock singer who disappeared from MTV years ago. Justin came over to give me a butt massage. After, he put his arms around me, we slept a full night of sleep, and he left.
